# QualGen Backend Challenge - 5-Minute Demo Script

## ðŸŽ¬ **Video Demo Plan for Job Applications**

### **Objective:** 
Create a professional 5-minute demo showcasing your QualGen Backend Coding Challenge solution to impress potential employers and demonstrate your full-stack engineering capabilities.

---

## **ðŸ“‹ Demo Script (5 Minutes)**

### **Segment 1: Introduction & Overview (0:00 - 0:45)**

**[Screen: README.md on GitHub]**

**Script:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to show you my solution to the QualGen Backend Coding Challenge. This project demonstrates a complete test orchestration platform that queues, groups, and deploys AppWright tests across multiple targets - emulating real-world CI/CD infrastructure."

**[Screen: GitHub repository overview]**

> "The challenge required building a CLI tool, backend service, and GitHub Actions integration. I not only met all requirements but delivered a production-ready solution with bonus features like an interactive dashboard and Docker deployment."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Full-stack solution (CLI + Backend + CI/CD)
- Production-ready architecture
- Exceeds basic requirements

---

### **Segment 2: Architecture & Code Quality (0:45 - 1:30)**

**[Screen: Project structure in VS Code]**

**Script:**
> "Let's look at the architecture. I built this using TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. The project follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns."

**[Show folder structure]**
- `src/cli/` - CLI tool implementation
- `src/server/` - Backend service with job orchestration
- `src/shared/` - Common types and utilities
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD automation

**[Screen: Key code files]**

> "The CLI communicates with the backend via REST API, implements smart job grouping by app_version_id to reduce installation overhead by 60-80%, and includes comprehensive error handling."

---

### **Segment 3: Live CLI Demonstration (1:30 - 2:45)**

**[Screen: Terminal]**

**Script:**
> "Now let's see it in action. First, I'll start the backend server..."

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Start the server
node test-server-enhanced.js
```

**[New terminal window]**

> "The CLI tool supports multiple commands. Let me submit a test job exactly as specified in the challenge..."

```bash
# Submit job as per challenge requirement
qgjob submit --org-id=qualgent --app-version-id=xxz123 --test=tests/onboarding.spec.js --priority=5 --target=emulator --server-url=http://localhost:3001
```

> "Notice how it returns a job ID. Now I'll check the status..."

```bash
# Check status
qgjob status --job-id=[job-id-from-output] --server-url=http://localhost:3001
```

> "Let me demonstrate the grouping feature by submitting multiple jobs with the same app version..."

```bash
# Submit multiple jobs to show grouping
qgjob submit --org-id=demo --app-version-id=v2.0.0 --test=tests/login.spec.js --target=emulator --server-url=http://localhost:3001

qgjob submit --org-id=demo --app-version-id=v2.0.0 --test=tests/checkout.spec.js --target=emulator --server-url=http://localhost:3001
```

> "And list all jobs to see the organization..."

```bash
# List jobs
qgjob list --org-id=demo --server-url=http://localhost:3001
```

---

### **Segment 4: Interactive Dashboard (2:45 - 3:30)**

**[Screen: Web browser at localhost:3001]**

**Script:**
> "Beyond the CLI, I built an interactive web dashboard for job management. This wasn't required but demonstrates UI/UX thinking and full-stack capabilities."

**[Navigate the dashboard]**
- Show job status overview
- Demonstrate API testing interface
- Show real-time job updates

> "The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for non-technical team members to monitor test execution and provides real-time insights into system performance."

---

### **Segment 5: GitHub Actions Integration (3:30 - 4:15)**

**[Screen: GitHub Actions page]**

**Script:**
> "The challenge required GitHub Actions integration. Here's my CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs the CLI during builds, exactly as requested."

**[Show workflow runs]**

> "You can see successful workflow runs that demonstrate the complete end-to-end functionality. The workflow builds the project, installs the CLI, starts a server, submits test jobs, and polls for completion - failing the build if any tests fail."

**[Screen: Workflow YAML file]**

> "The workflow is production-ready and demonstrates how teams would integrate this into their development process."

---

### **Segment 6: Technical Excellence & Wrap-up (4:15 - 5:00)**

**[Screen: Code quality metrics or architecture diagram]**

**Script:**
> "What makes this solution special? First, it's built with production scalability in mind - horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, and comprehensive monitoring. Second, I used AI tools effectively to accelerate development while maintaining high code quality."

**Key technical highlights:**
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular, testable architecture  
- Docker deployment ready
- Comprehensive error handling
- Smart job batching algorithms

**[Screen: Back to GitHub repo]**

> "This project showcases my ability to rapidly deliver production-ready solutions that exceed requirements. I'm excited about opportunities to bring this level of engineering excellence to your team."

**[End with contact information or call-to-action]**

## **ðŸŽ¥ Recording Setup Instructions**

### **Preparation:**
1. **Clean your desktop** - close unnecessary apps
2. **Prepare terminals** - have commands ready in history
3. **Test everything** - run through the demo once
4. **Good lighting** - if showing your face in intro
5. **Clear audio** - use a good microphone

### **Recording Tools:**
- **OBS Studio** (free, professional)
- **Loom** (easy screen recording)
- **Camtasia** (paid, full-featured)
- **Windows Game Bar** (built-in, simple)
